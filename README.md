# TODO-LIST
 This is a simple Task Manager built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks. The interface dynamically updates as tasks are added, completed, or removed. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating a user-friendly interface using vanilla JavaScript.
